### Notes  
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. Custom cell did not display all labels.  
Problem: After creating my custom cell with two labels (title, synopsis) and image, I run it on the simulator but the cell only displayed a fraction of the title.  
Even though I changed the height of the cell, it did not fix the problem. After receiving help from the TA and self-debugging, I changed the row height of the "TableViewCell" which resolved my problem.  

Solution: Change row height of "TableViewCell"  

2. AlamofireImage af_setImage method is deprecated  
  Problem: Following the tutorial, I was stuck when seeing the af_setImage was crossed out on my Xcode. I tried to search Google for the new method but couldn't find any. I then decided to use the deprecated method anyway. Then, Xcode suggested me with the new method.  

  Solution: Keep using it until Xcode suggest new method, New method: af.setImage(withUrl: URL)
